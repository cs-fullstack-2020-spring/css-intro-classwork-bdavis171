# CSS Intro to Selectors and Box Model

### Exercise 1:

Create a new HTML file called ```problem1_cw.html```, and copy the code below into the ```<body>``` of your HTML file. 
```
<h1>HTML Can be more Fun than Python</h1>
<h2>But is html more Fun than Java?</h2>
<p>Some thinks Switch-Cases are better than If statements.</p>
<p>Most think For Loops are better than While Loops.</p>
```
* Create an external CSS file called ```problem1.css``` and link it to your HTML file
* Add CSS selector to make the h1 tags red, padded on all sides by 20px, and display 25% from the left side of the web page
* Add CSS selector to make the h2 tags blue and have a 1px border
* Add a CSS selector and use it to make all instances of the word 'better' green with a ```font-weight``` of ```bold```


### Exercise 2:

Start with the included HTML file ```problem2_cw.html```. Create an external CSS file called ```problem2_cw.css``` and create selectors to style the HTML as follows:

* Give the p tags a gray background, and a right margin of 10%. 
* Make the class "secondParagraph" have a background color of blue, and horizontally centered on the page.
* Create selectors to set the background of the first, third, and fourth classes to pink with top and bottom padding of 10px.
* Create a selector that styles the text ```My First Jibberish Post!``` that sets block properties as follows:

width = 500px
height = 100px
padding = 10px
dashed border = 3px
And a setting that will keep the text horizontally centered on the page as the screen is resized

### Challenge:

Start with the included HTML file ```problem3_cw.html```. The starter HTML has an HTML table in it which we will talk more about later. See if you can create a CSS file called ```problem3_cw.css``` that will style the page to produce a tic-tac-toe web page like the one represented in ```problem3.png```

* The title and the tic-tac-toe board should stay vertically and horzontally centered on the wb page.
* Add additional styles to better format the title to use borders and a colored background
